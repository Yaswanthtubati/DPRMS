Disaster Prediction and Response Management System 

This project introduces a predictive disaster management system that employs machine learning (ML) models to anticipate and mitigate potential disasters. 

The system takes user-provided information, to deliver accurate and timely disaster predictions.Upon receiving the geographical details, information encompassing factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, mmi, nst, serves as input to trained ML models.

 The ML model utilizes historical and current data to generate precise predictions regarding potential disasters, such as Forest fires and Earthquakes.The project not only focuses on disaster prediction but also emphasizes the importance of proactive disaster management.
 
  It offers a live news feed regarding disasters and climate. Users, including government agencies and emergency response teams, can leverage the predictions to implement preventive measures and optimize resource allocation in vulnerable regions.
  
  This innovative approach ensures the scalability and adaptability of the system across diverse geographic locations, providing a valuable tool for disaster preparedness and response efforts. 
  
  By combining ML capabilities with geographic information, and news coverage, the project aims to contribute to the advancement of effective and data-driven disaster management strategies.
